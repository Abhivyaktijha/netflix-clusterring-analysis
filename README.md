The Netflix Content Navigator is a data science project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and unsupervised learning to analyze and cluster Netflix movies and TV shows based on their descriptions. By applying KMeans clustering, TF-IDF vectorization, and dimensionality reduction, the project segments content into meaningful groups, revealing patterns in genres and themes. A content-based recommendation system uses cosine similarity to suggest similar titles within clusters, enhancing content discovery. Interactive Plotly visualizations and detailed cluster profiling provide insights into genre and country distributions, making this project a powerful demonstration of NLP, machine learning, and data visualization skills.
This project showcases proficiency in:
NLP: TF-IDF vectorization and text preprocessing.
Unsupervised Learning: KMeans clustering and dimensionality reduction (TruncatedSVD).
Recommendation Systems: Cosine similarity for content-based recommendations.
Data Visualization: Interactive Plotly scatter plots and bar charts.
